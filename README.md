# Nim
Nim is a strategy game that involves two players that take turns removing objects from a pile

## Rules
The only rule of the game is that each player must take at least one object from the same pile, as many as they like, as long it is still available. E.g. if a row has 5 objects, the maxiumum you can take is 5 objects, if you try and take more an error will occur.
